# PlinkoGame
This is a Plinko game I made in processing for my Animation and Planning in Games, CSCI 5611,  class at UMN-TC
I run this in the Processing app you can find at this download: https://processing.org/download
You will one library to run it to get the sound of the ball which you can find in the Processing IDE at Tools->Manage Tools...->Libraires->Sound by The Processing Foundation

Once you download and extract the zip and have Processing downloaded, Run the Main file.

Some things to note is that since it is in Java and not C++ or run in a 3D environment, it is quite slow unless you have a powerful machine.
